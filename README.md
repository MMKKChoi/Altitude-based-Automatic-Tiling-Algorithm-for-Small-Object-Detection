## Introduction
In this paper, a method is proposed to perform consistent detection of small objects across all altitudes using UAVs. This approach determines the number of tiles for detecting small objects at each altitude. Real-time object detection was conducted on the AI board mounted on the UAV, and for this purpose, the model was optimized using a lightweighting process.
